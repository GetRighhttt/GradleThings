# Gradle

### What is Gradle?
- Build automation tool
  - Takes your code and packages it into deployable unit
  - applies to small or large projects
  - written in the Kotlin language
  - can also be written in Groovy
  - highly configurable to meet project needs

#### Why use Gradle
- Makes building and running applications very easy
- no need for people using your projects to install Gradle
  - Gradle wrapper comes bundled in with project
  - Just run `./graldew build` and you should be ok
- Very concise; no XML configuration needed
- lightning fast

#### Key Gradle Concepts
- `build.gradle.kts` is the Gradle build script file 
  - defines how project is build
  - written in Kotlin DSL
  - lives in top-level of the project
  - has `plugins`, `repositories`, and `dependencies`; also houses some metadata
- `tasks` defines a unit of work
  - invoked form the command line
  - `./gradlew build` is considered a build task
  - see a full list of available tasks by running `./gradlew tasks`
  - can also create own custom tasks
  - task can have dependencies on other tasks
  - creates a task graph of dependencies
- `wrapper` is the script used to invoke Gradle and run tasks
  - always committed into version control
  - no local Gradle installation required for anyone building your project
  - contains a specific version of gradle for the project
  - ALWAYS use the Gradle wrapper script for safety (unless initializing new gradle project)

#### Gradle Project Structure
- Gradle supports single-project and multi-project structures
  - single-project structures are usually for smaller projects with a single build output
  - multi-project structures are for larger projects with multiple build outputs

#### Typical Structure
| -- `build.gradle.kts` -> main build configuration file
| -- `gradle` -> contains configuration and code for Gradle wrapper
|   -- `wrapper`
|     | -- `gradle-wrapper.jar`
|       -- `gradle-wrapper.properties`
| -- `gradlew` -> gradle wrapper script (Windows and Linux)
| -- `gradlew.bat`
-- `settings.gradle.kts` -> set project name, and additional settings
- all files and directories should be committed into version control automatically 
- `.gradle` should not be committed into version control as it is hidden
  - project specific cache used internally by Gradle
- `.gitignore` automatically generated by gradle when a project is created
